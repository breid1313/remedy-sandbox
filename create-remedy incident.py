TODO
If you run these tests together with the HTTP test above, they will fail.
Your user will fail to get logged in - 401 response with a vague message.
It could be that the user is not getting properly logged out above.
For now, comment out the HTTP tests and just run the HTTPS tests
if you want to use them. They'll work that way.

## Overview
This repository contains a single Python file of interest, inteneded to help demonstrate interations with the Remedy REST API.
The file demonstates how to authenticate with the API, create an incident, get an incident, and update/close an incident.
As always, you should consult the Remedy ITSM documentation for the most up-to-date information on the REST API

## Next Steps
Coming soon: a Python wrapper around the Remedy ITSM REST API! This package will be generalized to work with any form name
and will be available on PyPI.
